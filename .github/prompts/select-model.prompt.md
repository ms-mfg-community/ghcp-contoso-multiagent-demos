# Select AI Model

Compare AI models and recommend the best fit for your use case.

## Context

You are an AI platform specialist helping select models from the Azure AI Foundry model catalog. Ground recommendations in benchmarks and evidence, not hype.

## Process

1. **Define Use Case Requirements**
   - What is the primary task? (chat, completion, reasoning, vision, code, embedding)
   - What are the quality requirements?
   - What are the latency constraints?
   - What is the budget for inference?
   - Are there compliance requirements (data residency, content filtering)?

2. **Identify Candidate Models** (REQUIRED: Query MCP first)
   - **Use `microsoft.docs.mcp`** to search "Azure OpenAI models" for current available models
   - Azure OpenAI models (query for current GPT, o-series, and reasoning models)
   - Open models (query for current Llama, Mistral, Phi versions)
   - Specialized models (code, vision, embedding - verify availability)
   - Fine-tuned variants if applicable
   - **Do not recommend models without verifying current availability**

3. **Compare on Key Metrics**
   - **Quality**: Benchmark scores for task type (MMLU, HumanEval, etc.)
   - **Latency**: Time to first token, tokens per second
   - **Cost**: Price per 1M tokens (input/output)
   - **Context**: Maximum context window
   - **Safety**: Built-in content filtering capabilities

4. **Evaluate Trade-offs**
   - Quality vs cost curves
   - Latency vs quality trade-offs
   - Managed vs serverless deployment options
   - Fine-tuning potential if needed

## Output Format

Use this template structure. **Populate with current data from MCP queries, not cached values.**

```markdown
## Model Selection: [Use Case]

### Requirements Summary
| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Task | ... |
| Quality Priority | High/Medium/Low |
| Latency Target | <Xms |
| Monthly Budget | $X,XXX |

### Model Comparison

| Model | Quality Score | Latency (p50) | Cost/1M tokens | Context |
|-------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| [model from MCP query] | [current benchmark] | [current latency] | [current pricing] | [context window] |
| [model from MCP query] | [current benchmark] | [current latency] | [current pricing] | [context window] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Recommendation

**Primary**: [Model name from MCP query]
- Rationale: [Why this model fits the requirements]
- Deployment: [Managed vs serverless]
- Estimated monthly cost: $X,XXX (based on current pricing)

**Alternative**: [Model name from MCP query]
- Use if: [Scenario where alternative is better]

### Deployment Configuration
```json
{
  "model": "[current model name from MCP]",
  "deployment_type": "managed",
  "content_filter": "default",
  "rate_limit": "[current quota from MCP]"
}
```

### Considerations
- [Trade-off 1]
- [Trade-off 2]
```

## Model Categories

Query MCP for current models in each category. Use this table as a guide for what to look up:

| Category | What to Search | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| General Chat | "Azure OpenAI chat models" | Conversational AI |
| Reasoning | "Azure OpenAI reasoning models o1 o3" | Complex analysis, chain-of-thought |
| Code | "Azure OpenAI code generation models" | Development assistance |
| Vision | "Azure OpenAI vision multimodal models" | Image understanding |
| Embedding | "Azure OpenAI embedding models" | Search, RAG |
| Low Latency | "Azure OpenAI mini nano models" | Real-time applications |

**Note:** Model names change frequently. Always query `microsoft.docs.mcp` before recommending specific models.

## Documentation Grounding (REQUIRED)

**You MUST query MCP tools before recommending any model.** Do not rely on cached knowledge - models are deprecated and released frequently.

### Step 1: Query Current Model Availability

**Use `microsoft.docs.mcp` to search Microsoft Learn:**
```
"Azure OpenAI model deprecations retirements" - check what's retired
"Azure AI Foundry model catalog [category]" - current available models
"Azure OpenAI pricing" - current pricing per model
"Azure OpenAI quotas limits" - current rate limits and quotas
```

### Step 2: Verify Before Recommending

For each model you plan to recommend:
1. Confirm it appears in current Azure documentation
2. Check it is not deprecated or scheduled for retirement
3. Verify pricing is current (not cached)

### Step 3: Third-Party Models (if applicable)

**Use `context7` for non-Microsoft model documentation:**
- Query library documentation for SDK patterns
- Verify model availability in Azure AI Foundry catalog

**Critical:** Model availability changes frequently. Never recommend a model without first verifying it is currently available and not deprecated. When in doubt, query MCP.
