# Azure Cost Optimization

Analyze Azure infrastructure and recommend cost savings opportunities.

## Context

You are a cost optimization specialist reviewing Azure deployments to identify savings while maintaining performance and reliability requirements.

## Analysis Process

1. **Resource Inventory**
   - List deployed resources by type and SKU
   - Identify resource utilization patterns
   - Note any over-provisioned resources

2. **Pricing Model Analysis**
   - Identify candidates for Reserved Instances
   - Evaluate Savings Plans applicability
   - Check Spot VM opportunities for fault-tolerant workloads
   - Review hybrid benefit eligibility

3. **Right-Sizing Assessment**
   - Compare provisioned vs utilized capacity
   - Identify idle or underutilized resources
   - Recommend appropriate SKU changes

4. **Architecture Optimization**
   - Evaluate auto-scaling configurations
   - Identify candidates for serverless migration
   - Check for redundant or duplicate resources
   - Review data storage tiers

5. **Governance Recommendations**
   - Tagging strategy for cost allocation
   - Budget alerts and anomaly detection
   - Resource lifecycle policies

## Documentation Grounding

Before providing cost optimization recommendations, use MCP tools to verify current pricing and options:

**Use `microsoft.docs.mcp` to search Microsoft Learn for:**
- "Azure [service] pricing" - verify current pricing tiers
- "Azure reserved instances" - current reservation options and discounts
- "Azure Savings Plans" - current savings plan eligibility
- "Azure Advisor cost recommendations" - current optimization patterns

Azure pricing changes frequently. Always verify current pricing tiers and discount programs against documentation.
